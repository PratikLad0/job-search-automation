        <p>Dear Hiring Manager,</p>
    </div>

    <div class="body">
        <p>I'm thrilled to apply for the Backend Software Engineer II position at foodpanda, where I can leverage my expertise in building scalable and efficient backend systems to drive innovation. As a seasoned software engineer with over 4 years of experience, I've had the privilege of working on cutting-edge projects that push the boundaries of technology.</p>
<p>With a strong background in C#, Node.js, and Python, I'm confident in my ability to craft robust REST APIs and microservices that meet the demands of high-traffic applications. My experience with web frameworks such as Express.js and FastAPI has allowed me to optimize runtime performance by up to 40% for VR/AR and 3D applications, a skillset I believe would be highly valued in this role.</p>
<p>In my current position at Techwarium India Pvt Ltd, I've had the opportunity to work on notable projects such as Joytree VR Shopping App, TracXpert Inventory Intelligence Platform, and Lalaverse 3D Mall Platform. Notably, I improved data retrieval speed by 20% for a major e-commerce application, demonstrating my ability to drive tangible results.</p>
<p>I'm excited about the prospect of joining foodpanda's team in Singapore and contributing my skills and expertise to help shape the future of online ordering and delivery. With a willingness to relocate and adapt to a new culture, I'm confident that I would be an excellent fit for this role.</p>
<p>Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing how my skills and experience align with foodpanda's vision and objectives. Please feel free to contact me at your convenience.</p>
<p>Sincerely,
Pratik Lad</p>
